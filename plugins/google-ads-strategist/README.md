# google-ads-strategist

A senior-level Google Ads strategist agent that designs campaigns through an **iterative improvement process** and verifies every iteration in the real browser before a cent is spent.

## Mission Fit

`google-ads-strategist` is the paid-acquisition and revenue-learning arm of the SaaS loop.
It turns buyer-intent hypotheses, SERP evidence, and campaign metrics into growth actions
and product feedback while keeping spend controlled and attributable.

## Installation

- **Install for you** (user scope) — available in all your projects:
  `/plugin install google-ads-strategist@paat-plugins`
- **Install for all collaborators on this repository** (project scope) — commit `.claude/settings.json` with the plugin enabled.
- **Install for you, in this repo only** (local scope) — enable it in `.claude/settings.local.json`.

## Three revenue rules (enforced, not suggested)

1. **Every final URL has UTM parameters.** Without attribution, iteration can't learn what drove revenue. Every spec carries `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, `utm_content=<iteration>`, and `utm_term={keyword}`. `/ads-ready` refuses to pass a spec without them.
2. **Every campaign has a defensive branded ad group.** Competitors will bid on your brand if you don't — defensive own-brand capture is the first thing v1 auto-generates when `brand_name` exists in `brief.md`.
3. **Buyer intent, not content relevance.** PPC spend only follows commercial + transactional queries. Informational modifiers become Day-1 negatives, not Week-3 lessons. Every keyword is SERP-verified to confirm commercial signals before entering a spec.

## Core discipline

- One hypothesis per iteration, **single-variable changes only**, browser-verified at every step
- Every iteration includes `forecast.md`, `negatives.md`, and `flags-for-investor.md` as standard v1 artifacts
- **Creates campaigns in Google Ads via Chrome in PAUSED state** — the investor reviews in the Ads UI and enables when satisfied
- The plugin **never enables, activates, or launches** campaigns — that's the investor's action after review

## What it does

- **Pre-launch loop**: rapid hypothesis → Ad Preview Tool verification → competitive SERP capture → diagnose → revise, until every target keyword triggers the ad at position ≤ 3 with differentiated copy
- **Post-launch loop**: metrics pull → symptom diagnosis → single-variable hypothesis → wait gate → measure → update learnings
- **Per-campaign memory**: every campaign lives in `docs/ads/<campaign>/` as versioned iterations with hypotheses, results, and an accumulating `learnings.md`
- **Cross-campaign learnings**: patterns that hold across ≥ 2 campaigns graduate to project-level auto-memory
- **Chrome-first**: uses the Anonymous Ad Preview Tool, real Google SERP, and Google Ads Transparency Center via the `claude-in-chrome` MCP server — no Google Ads API developer token required

## Requirements

- Claude Code with the `claude-in-chrome` MCP server installed and logged into the user's Chrome browser
- `jq` on PATH (hook scripts parse the tool input JSON via jq)
- `git` on PATH and a Git worktree (campaign-path confinement resolves the repository root)
- GNU `grep` with PCRE support (`grep -P`) — used by `check-single-variable.sh`, `check-estonian-diacritics.sh`, and `check-hypothesis-log.sh`; default on Linux, not on macOS unless replaced with `ggrep`
- GNU `date` (`date -d`) — used by `check-wait-gate.sh` to parse ISO timestamps; default on Linux. On macOS install `coreutils` — the script prefers `gdate` when available.
- Bash 4+ / standard POSIX tools
- Optional: logged-in Google Ads account in Chrome. Campaign creation needs an account that can create PAUSED campaigns; all post-launch metrics pulls require a separate server-enforced **Read only** user.

No Google Ads API access is required for pre-launch design + verification. The Anonymous Ad Preview Tool is public and works for any keyword / location / device.

## Components

### Agent
- `ads-strategist` — senior PPC strategist, design-only, iteration-first discipline
- `ads-metrics-reader` — constrained post-launch reader with no shell or file-write tools

### Commands
- `/ads-brief [name]` — create a new campaign folder + brief.md (interactive intake)
- `/ads-iterate` — run one iteration of the active campaign (delegates to ads-strategist)
- `/ads-create` — **build the campaign in Google Ads via Chrome** — creates in PAUSED state for investor review
- `/ads-verify [keyword]` — quick one-shot Ad Preview Tool verification
- `/ads-serp <keyword>` — capture real Google SERP in incognito and classify buyer intent
- `/ads-spy <competitor>` — pull all currently-running ads from the Google Ads Transparency Center
- `/ads-diff <v_a> <v_b>` — show what changed between two iterations
- `/ads-hypothesize` — propose 3-5 ranked candidate hypotheses for the next iteration
- `/ads-ready` — audit the current iteration against the launch-readiness checklist
- `/ads-audit [account|campaign]` — read-only audit of an existing account/campaign before takeover, scaling, or iteration; produces severity-rated findings with evidence and follow-up hypotheses
- `/ads-metrics` — pull live campaign metrics via Chrome and persist evidence (post-launch only)
- `/ads-monitor` — zero-repository-write metrics pass using a server-enforced Google Ads read-only user
- `/ads-distill` — roll the hypothesis log into learnings and propose graduation candidates

### Skills
- `buyer-intent-targeting` — **first filter** — every keyword classified by intent; informational dropped; product-value gate
- `iterative-campaign-design` — pre-launch iteration loop discipline
- `iterative-optimization` — post-launch iteration loop decision tree
- `hypothesis-journaling` — how to write falsifiable hypotheses and distill learnings
- `browser-verification` — Chrome playbook for Ad Preview Tool (with small-market reliability warning), SERP capture, Transparency Center, and Google Ads UI metrics
- `competitor-intel` — Transparency Center workflow + differentiation matrix (with iframe workaround)
- `clickable-copy` — RSA formulas per intent class, Quality Score alignment, character-count discipline
- `chrome-campaign-creation` — **step-by-step Chrome playbook for building campaigns in Google Ads UI** in PAUSED state

### Hooks
All hooks are **PreToolUse** — they block before the tool runs. The Write-gated checks match both `Write` and `Edit`.
- **Chrome navigate** → `check-launch-block.sh` — allows campaign creation URLs, warns on Ads dashboard navigation (must create PAUSED), blocks billing URLs
- **Write / Edit** → `check-hypothesis-present.sh` — blocks writing `iterations/vN/spec.md` without a sibling `hypothesis.md`
- **Write / Edit** → `check-single-variable.sh` — validates that `hypothesis.md` declares exactly one variable class (or justified multivariate)
- **Write / Edit** → `check-wait-gate.sh` — post-launch only, blocks iteration specs before ≥ 7 days since last apply (for statistical significance)
- **Write / Edit** → `check-hypothesis-log.sh` — blocks writing `result.md` without a corresponding `hypothesis-log.md` entry
- **Write / Edit** → `check-estonian-diacritics.sh` — blocks writing an Estonian `spec.md` that uses ASCII substitutes for diacritics (ä, ö, ü, õ, š, ž)

### Templates
Located in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/`:
- `campaign-brief.md`
- `iteration-hypothesis.md`
- `iteration-spec.md`
- `iteration-result.md`
- `learnings.md`
- `hypothesis-log.md`

## Campaign folder structure

```
docs/ads/<campaign>/
├── brief.md                         # product, audience, budget, goals, brand, final_url_template, forecast baseline
├── launched_at                      # marker file — presence + ISO timestamp = campaign is live
├── wait_days                        # optional — override default 7-day post-launch wait gate

├── hypothesis-log.md                # append-only ledger
├── learnings.md                     # distilled patterns
└── current -> iterations/v3         # symlink to active iteration
```

State is tracked via plain marker files (`launched_at`, `applied_at`) — no embedded state in markdown. The hooks read these directly. `/ads-create` records the exact Google Ads customer and campaign IDs in `brief.md`; metrics runs fail closed if either identity is missing.

## Typical workflow (pre-launch)

```
/ads-brief <product>-commercial-ee     # intake, create folder
/ads-iterate                           # agent generates v1 hypothesis
# review → approve → agent writes spec + verifies
/ads-iterate                           # agent generates v2 hypothesis (if needed)
...
/ads-ready                             # final audit against launch checklist
/ads-create                            # agent builds campaign in Google Ads UI via Chrome (PAUSED)
# investor reviews campaign in Ads UI → enables when satisfied
```

## Typical workflow (post-launch)

```
/ads-monitor                           # inspect current numbers without writing artifacts
/ads-metrics                           # persist the evidence-backed metrics report
/ads-hypothesize                       # see candidate fixes, ranked
/ads-iterate                           # agent writes next hypothesis
# approve → agent writes spec → you apply it to the live account
# wait 7 days (enforced by hook)
/ads-metrics                           # measure the delta
/ads-distill                           # every ~5 iterations, distill learnings
```

## Existing account audit

Use `/ads-audit` when the campaign or account already exists and you need a takeover/scaling/readiness assessment before changing spend.

```
/ads-audit campaign --tracking --search-terms
```

`/ads-ready` checks whether this plugin's current pre-launch iteration is ready to create/launch. `/ads-audit` inspects an existing account/campaign and stays read-only. It writes `docs/ads/<campaign>/audit/YYYY-MM-DD.md` or `docs/ads/_account-audits/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with:

- executive summary;
- critical/high/medium/low findings;
- evidence links or screenshots;
- exact fix instructions;
- follow-up one-variable hypotheses that can feed `/ads-iterate`.

Every high/critical finding needs concrete evidence. If evidence is unavailable, the audit states the access gap instead of fabricating a conclusion.

## Safety & boundaries

**Hard limits enforced by hooks:**
- Never navigates to Google Ads billing URLs (campaign creation is allowed; Ads dashboard navigation is warned to enforce PAUSED-only)
- Never writes a spec.md without a hypothesis.md
- Never accepts a hypothesis without a declared variable class
- Never accepts a multivariate hypothesis without written justification
- Never proposes a post-launch iteration before the wait gate opens

**Soft limits via skill discipline:**
- Never targets informational buyer intent
- Never routes paid traffic to blog/guide pages
- Drops keywords that fail the product-value gate (product can't deliver value even if intent is commercial)
- Never fabricates metrics or verification results — every claim requires a screenshot or page capture on disk

**What the plugin does NOT do:**
- Enable, activate, or launch campaigns — creates in PAUSED state only, investor enables
- Click any "Enable" toggle or status-change control in the Ads UI
- Access Google Ads billing
- Click on competitor ads in real SERPs
- Use third-party SERP scrapers (Transparency Center is Google's own first-party source)

## Relationship to other plugins

- **saas-startup-team** delegates all Google Ads work to this plugin (hard dependency). Its `growth-hacker` no longer creates Google Ads campaigns: it flags a `## Google Ads request` in its growth report, and the `/growth` loop spawns `ads-strategist` at the team-lead level. The investor can also trigger it directly with `/saas-startup-team:ads`. Both spawn `ads-strategist` by its registered agent type.
- `ads-strategist` designs, browser-verifies, and creates the campaign in **PAUSED** state; the investor enables it. saas-startup-team tracks campaigns via a `docs/growth/channels/ads.md` index that links into the `docs/ads/<campaign>/` folders this plugin owns.
- Standalone use is unchanged: `/ads-brief` + `/ads-iterate` + `/ads-ready` + `/ads-create` work without saas-startup-team.
